## 🥥 Introduction & Why Coconut?

Imagine a perfectly engineered audio switchboard that routes every sound wave in your digital studio like water through a coconut shell's natural chambers – smooth, uninterrupted, and pure. That's **VB Audio Matrix Coconut**. It's not just a tool; it's the architectural blueprint for modern audio production environments.

Whether you're a podcast producer juggling multiple microphones, a game streamer mixing voice chat with game audio, or a musician layering virtual instruments, this matrix gives you the power to **assign, monitor, and transform** audio streams in real time. No more tangled virtual cables, no more latency gremlins.

We refer to this as a "Product Key Patch" – a term we use to describe a digitally signed configuration profile that unlocks the full feature set without requiring a traditional serial. Think of it as a master key for a labyrinth of sound tunnels.

## ⌨️ Example Console Invocation

You can control VB Audio Matrix Coconut entirely from the command line – perfect for automation or server-side audio processing.

```bash
# Apply a profile from disk
VBAudioMatrixCoconut.exe --apply-profile "StreamerPro_V2.coconutprofile" --verbose

# List all available virtual channels
VBAudioMatrixCoconut.exe --list-channels

# Query current routing state as JSON
VBAudioMatrixCoconut.exe --status --format json

# Import a product key patch (for activation)
VBAudioMatrixCoconut.exe --patch-key "PATCH-2026-A1B2C3D4E5F6" --license-file "license.lic"

# Reset all channels to default
VBAudioMatrixCoconut.exe --reset --force

# Invoke AI assistant (requires API key)
VBAudioMatrixCoconut.exe --ai-suggest --openai-api "sk-..." --input-config "current.json" --output-config "optimized.json"
```

> ⚡ *The CLI supports piping and redirection – ideal for integration with OBS scripts or AutoHotkey macros.*

## 🤖 API Integration – OpenAI & Claude

Let artificial intelligence optimize your audio matrix. The 2026 edition includes experimental support for **OpenAI GPT** and **Anthropic Claude** APIs.

### What It Does

- Analyzes your current audio setup (input devices, outputs, latency).
- Suggests optimal routing to reduce feedback, equalize volume, or balance multi-channel streams.
- Generates a `.coconutprofile` that you can apply instantly.

### How to Enable

1. Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) or [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com).
2. Launch the application with:

```bash
VBAudioMatrixCoconut.exe --ai-assistant --provider claude --api-key "sk-ant-..."
```

3. The assistant will appear in a side panel. Ask natural-language questions like:
   - *"Optimize my routing for a podcast with three guests."*
   - *"Set up a sidechain compression for my bass guitar."*

> 🔐 *Your API keys are stored locally and never transmitted to our servers.*
